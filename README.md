# Stars NFT Generation and Data Hosting

![Cover](/coverimage.png)

This repository contains a real example of the workflow for:

1. Algorithmically generating a set of NFTs wiith tiered rarity structure.

2. Hosting the image and metadata for the generated NFT set on Github.

3. Creating an ERC721 smart contract in Solidity with contract metadata linked to Github hosting.

## Requirements
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), or some any PNG photo editing program.
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)(Online), or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)(CLI) for deployment and minting.

## Notes Before Using This Code
-  If you want to create AND HOST your own NFT set using this code: FORK THIS REPOSITORY.
-  If you want to create your own NFT set and NOT host it here, or if you simply just want to experiment:  CLONE THIS REPOSITORY.

## Usage

Once dependencies are all installed, enter the <i> starsnft </i> directory with <i> cd starsnft </i> after cloning/forking. This is the main working directory for this project and is where all commands should be entered. Below are the steps for replicating this project.

### Step 1: Creating Attributes

Ideas, create directories in 'parts' like example.

### Step 2

Generate

### Step 3

Change contract values, deploy contract on Remix

## DISCLAIMER

Something about money and NFTs and blockchain etc.
